Project: Dynamic Array Implementation

Description:
Create a C program that implements a dynamic array data structure from scratch. Dynamic arrays automatically resize themselves when needed, allowing you to add or remove elements dynamically.

Features:

1. Dynamic Array Creation: Implement a function that creates a dynamic array with a specified initial capacity.

2. Insertion and Deletion: Develop functions to insert elements at the end of the array and delete elements from any position.

3. Array Resizing: Implement logic to automatically resize the array when it reaches full capacity or shrinks it when elements are removed.

4. Array Operations: Include functions to access elements by index, check if the array is empty, get the size of the array, and clear the array.

5. Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, such as when trying to access an out-of-bounds element or deleting from an empty array.

6. Interactive Menu:  Create an interactive menu-driven program that allows users to perform various array operations, including inserting, deleting, and displaying elements.

Challenges:

1. Designing a memory-efficient dynamic array that can grow and shrink as needed.

2. Implementing array resizing algorithms and ensuring efficient memory management.

3. Handling edge cases and potential errors, such as out-of-bounds access.

4. Creating an interactive user interface for users to interact with the dynamic array.

Additional Ideas:

- Implement dynamic arrays of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, structures) by using C's `void*` and allowing the user to specify the data type.

- Incorporate error checking and use dynamic memory allocation functions like `malloc` and `free` for memory management.

- Add features like sorting the array, searching for specific elements, and displaying statistics like the mean, median, and mode of the array elements.

- Optimize the dynamic array implementation for efficiency, both in terms of memory and execution speed.

This project will deepen my understanding of arrays in C and provide valuable experience in dynamic memory allocation and data structure implementation. It's a practical way to learn about memory management and array manipulation in C.
